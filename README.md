# Challenge 9, Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Project Overview
In this challenge we will find a few key aspects of Oahuâ€™s seasonal weather data in the month of June and December over the available years.

The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June and December.
2. Compare your findings between the month of June and December.


## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook

# Summary
We'll gather data on the seasons of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect a surf and ice cream shop business. We'll investigate the precipitation and temperature in the month of June and December.

1. Compare findings between the month of June and December:
-Month of June had a total of 1,700 datapoints while month of December had 1,517 datapoints.
-In both cases, all the datapoints had temperature information while 7.5 % of datapoints did not show any precepitation-so not-rainy days.
-Overal, standard deviation in precipitation data was higher than temperature data in both June and December, which means that the temperature data are more scattered compared to precipitation data in both cases.
-Precipitation data are more scattered in the month of December.
-Overal December is colder than June with lower min and max temperature, and has more precipitation(with higher min and max precipitation) compared to June.
-The 25, 50, and 75 percentile precipitations and temperature in DEcember are higher and lower, respectively, compared to Juen.


2. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
-Look through 3-months seasonal data as opposed to one month only.
-Check out the flight information with Oahu destination and investigate precipitation and temperature in months with the highest travels rates.
